Project:
 
Zeaker is an online platform that allows freelance Software Developers to find paid jobs for the BSV blockchain. It also allows other creators to post jobs so that the two parties can meet and achieve their goals. 

Project Description:

Basically, Zeaker is a platform for seeking out people. More specifically, it is both for people that need help to build on the BSV blockchain and for people seeking independent work on the web. 

It allows for creators to create a posting account, so they can post jobs or duties that they need completed and it allows web developers to create an account to look at the post/jobs made by creators so that they can fill that need or employment position. 

For many people, a main goal in life is to find freedom. This app allows people to free themselves from the current monotony of daily employment. In achieving this goal, we believe people will be happier and thus produce better quality work. Our motto is: “At play, we produce better, period”. As the backbone of technological society, developers need to be able to create anywhere they are happiest: on the beach, in the woods, in the mountains, in solitude or near family, and the list goes on. Wherever the creating power of the developer can get harnessed best is where the highest quality of work will be achieved. 

For example, when you go out to eat and the staff is in a bad mood, the food quality will seem lacking. However, if you go somewhere where the staff has synergy and people are having a good time, the food quality will seem great. 

At school, if a teacher is burnt out and has no love or sympathy for the students, the students’ energy will reciprocate that of the classroom's ambiance, and they will not produce as best that they can. However, if your room is like that of Ms. Frizzle’s from the Magic School Bus, where there is a palpable joy in teaching, students will actively engage and perform at their best. 

For the employer, the goal is to have happy developers that can work from anywhere in the world while simultaneously saving on the costs associated with leasing or buying office space and supplies, utilities, insurance, etc.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
